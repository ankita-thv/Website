    Blair, a waitress in the kingdom of Gardania, realises that she strongly resembles the region's missing queen. She then gets to go to Princess Charm School. While exploring the royal palace, Blair and her roommates happen upon a portrait of a young Queen Isabella and note her striking resemblance to Blair. Learning that Blair was found by her adoptive mother on the same day the royal family died in a car crash, Isla and Hadley deduce that she is Queen Isabellaâ€™s long-lost daughter, Princess Sophia and the true heir to the throne.
